# **Cyber Lab Server**

**Cyber Lab Server** is a comprehensive, live network infrastructure project designed to demonstrate the foundational setup for building and expanding a custom server environment. It incorporates **Cisco 1941 routers** for secure traffic management and **Catalyst 2960-X switches** to ensure stable, scalable network connectivity. The setup is powered by a **Dell R720 server** running **Proxmox**, enabling virtualization and resource allocation.

# **Network SIEM**

Beyond the foundational infrastructure, this project aims to show the potential of integration with additional systems such as **Windows Server 2019** and **Ubuntu Linux** environments. Splunk Enterprise is deployed on the Ubuntu server to enable centralized log collection and analysis, offering robust capabilities for **real-time monitoring**, **threat detection**, and **incident response**. This flexible setup also supports network management, security monitoring, and **SIEM testing**, with ample room for future expansion and customization to meet evolving operational needs.

## **SIEM Benefits**
- **Proactive threat detection** through centralized log collection and analysis  
- **Faster incident response** with automated alerts and reporting  
- **Scalable infrastructure** to grow as security needs expand  
- **Improved security posture** with continuous monitoring and anomaly detection  
- **Enhanced compliance** by maintaining detailed logs and reports  
- **Increased operational efficiency** by automating routine security tasks
